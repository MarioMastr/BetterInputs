# BetterInputs

The CCTextInputNode implementation Robert was too lazy to implement.

## Features

- Text selection
- Better text input™️
- Ctrl+A, Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow, Shift + Left/Right Arrow, Home, End and a bunch more hotkeys
- Esc to deselect an input node

Ya that's pretty much it for now, at least.
